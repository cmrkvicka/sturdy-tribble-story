Once upon a time there was a man named Bobby. He was on his daily jog along the bike bath in Madison, WI in the middle of
beautiful sunny August. He was coming up on the most difficult part of his journey, Bobby was on mile three of his six 
mile run. In what seemed to be a blissful middle of nowhere kind of place, he stopped to admire the scenary. The brush of the
wind on the tall green grass that came up to the waist all around the pavement path, the singing of the birds around every
tree that seemed to span every few yards around him, Bobby was in awe. Suddenly, Bobby hears a scream.

He suddenly stops running, turning towards the source of the scream. Yet, no one was there. Confused,
he started jogging towards where the scream came from, however he could still not find who it was that
was screaming.

There! Another scream! This time, to his left! He dashed over towards the forest, determined to get
to the bottom of the issue. However, again, his search bore no fruit.

Then he heard footsteps.

He instantly turned towards where the footsteps are coming from, and froze. There was no saving him now.
The last thing that crossed his mind was his regret for not finding who it was that was screaming...
