Once upon a time there was a man named Bobby. He was on his daily jog along the bike bath in Madison, WI in the middle of
beautiful sunny August. He was coming up on the most difficult part of his journey, Bobby was on mile three of his six 
mile run. In what seemed to be a blissful middle of nowhere kind of place, he stopped to admire the scenary. The brush of the
wind on the tall green grass that came up to the waist all around the pavement path, the singing of the birds around every
tree that seemed to span every few yards around him, Bobby was in awe. Suddenly, Bobby hears a scream.
